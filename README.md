# Description

A real-time multi-player 5d-chess app using [node](https://github.com/joyent/node), [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express), and of course [socket.io](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io).

Based off the psychological horror game on steam, 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel. (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/)

UI is based off thebinarypenguin's node.js chess application, which can currently be found at [chess.thebinarypenguin.com](http://chess.thebinarypenguin.com).
